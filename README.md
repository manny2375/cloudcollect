## üîí Multi-Tenant Architecture

CloudCollect uses a **4-digit numeric company code** system for complete tenant isolation:

- Each company gets a unique 4-digit code (e.g., `1234`, `5678`)
- All data is completely isolated by company
- Users can only access their company's data
- Database queries are automatically scoped to company

### Company Code Examples
- `1234` - Demo Company
- `5678` - Test Company  
- `9999` - Development Company

### Company Isolation Features
